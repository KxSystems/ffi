# FFI for kdb+

`ffikdb` is an extension to kdb+ for loading and calling dynamic libraries using pure `q`. 
It is part of the [_Fusion for kdb+_](https://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/fusion/) interface collection.

The main purpose of the library is to build stable interfaces on top of external libraries, or to interact with the operating system from `q`. No compiler toolchain or writing C/C++ code is required to use this library.

We are grateful to @abalkin for allowing us to adapt and expand on his original codebase. 

Please [report issues](https://github.com/KxSystems/ffikdb/issues) in this repository.

## Unsupported Functionality

Foreign functions taking a struct do not work properly (can cause crash). For example, a function taking `K` pointer does not work.
